# WORDLE CLI

The word list was obtained from [here](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt), and it contains some hellish entries, so this is going to be harder than the standard Wordle game you might be used to.

This repo also contains a Wordle solver.

Here is the demo of the game:
